<div data-spy="scroll" data-target="#list-example" data-offset="0" class="scrollspy-example">
    <h4 id="list-item-1">What the study is about</h4>
    <p>Provide a clear, concise explanation in lay language of the purposes of the research, including prominent use of the term "research." (Note: the IRB can waive this element if the study requires deception. In such cases, a debriefing statement should also be used to inform participants at an appropriate time after their involvement in the study.)</p>
    <h4 id="list-item-2">What we will ask you to do</h4>
    <p>Explain in simple, non-scientific language what will happen to the participant or what s/he will be asked to do in the study. Describe the participant time commitment for each component. All procedures listed in the IRB application and funding proposal should be described, and any experimental procedures (interventions, manipulations, treatments) specifically noted.</p>
    <h4 id="list-item-3">Risks and discomforts</h4>
    <p>In simple, non-scientific language, describe any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts: Legal risks (e.g., possibility of discovering activities that may require reporting to authorities, possibility of being arrested) , Physical risks (e.g., nausea, muscle aches, rashes, infection, discomfort) , Social or economic risks (e.g., loss of confidentiality; effect on financial standing, employability, or insurability) , Emotional risks (e.g., feelings of sadness or anxiety)</p>
    <h4 id="list-item-4">Benefits</h4>
    <p>Describe any probable benefits of participation. Be sure to distinguish between a likely direct benefit (e.g., from therapeutic or intervention research) and a possible indirect benefit (e.g., reflecting on an experience may lead to a better understanding of oneself). If there are no direct benefits, indicate that there are none.</p>
